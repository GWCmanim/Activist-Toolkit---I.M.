  <h2 id="heading1"> Problem Being Addressed</h2> 

  <h3 class="causeWriting">The problem I am addressing is air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution or waste. Everyone is affected by these three environmental issues. This is why I created this site, to provide statistics and information on pollution in the environment and to provide access to petitions and political leaders. </h3>
 </div1> 
 




  <h2 class="headings">My Cause </h2>

  
    <h3 class="causeWriting1"> My cause is to bring awareness to water, air, and waste pollution. Also, to encourage those who view this website to take action against pollution as well as inform others about it. I want there to be a healthier and happier future where people don’t have to face airborne and waterborne diseases or famine due to climate change and pollution. Another reason why I chose this topic is because I don’t think enough action is being taken against pollution, and a lot of people aren’t aware of the causes and effects of pollution or their contribution to it. My own community faces a lot of health issues and challenges caused by land pollution, with trash everywhere, air pollution, from fossil fuels from factories and cars, and water pollution, with a lot of sewage and runoff entering our streams and rivers. </h3> 

    <h2 class="headings"> Why I Care About This Cause </h2>

    <h3 class="causeWriting2"> I care about polluting the environment because it can have very detrimental effects on people and animals on the earth. Since everything on earth is affected by it, pollution and damaging the environment should be taken seriously.</h3> 

  <h3 class="cause"> 1. Everyone is affected by pollution</h3>
  <h3 class="cause"> 2. The amount of  pollution and its effects are continuously growing </h3>
  <h3 class="cause"> 3. I am active in learning about and advocating for a better environment
       (I am an alumn of the Philadelphia Watershed Stewardship Program f.k.a. Cobbs Creek Watershed Stewardship Program and am currently a steward in the  Wissahickon Restoration Volunteer Program)</h3>   



   <h2 class="headings"> Intended Audience </h2>

   <h3 id="audienceWriting"> This website is intended for most everyday people, who aren’t impacted or educated on environmental issues. It is also for those who are impacted, and would like to gain insight (information and statistics) on the problem.

<h2 class="headings"> Who can help advocate? </h2>

    <h2 id="advocate"> Anyone and everyone can participate in advocating for better environmental practices, no matter their age or ability. </h2>


    <p id="misconception">This site was not created to only provide information on environmental issues, its purpose is to also encourage its readers to take action!
